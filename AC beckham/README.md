you will see dELeteTHIs and rEmoVEtHIs

let's remove them and decrypt without them this

the result is this 

### nexus{w00000W_n0W_Y0U_Kn0w_th3_f0rm4t_0F_b453_32!!!8213245}

i make this code sol.py because i need to clean the string to contain uppercase letters A–Z and digits 2–7.

Padding with = may be required to make its length a multiple of 8.those are the criteria of base32
