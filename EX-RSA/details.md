this challenge is about multi RSA  and XOR 
first they give ecrypt.txt a lot of hex lines and they mentioned in description 1443 day 

so what i do first i go to the line 1443 and observe using line.py script  i find that it's length more long than the others and they give us the information to do our RSA 

so i factor n using the website factor.db ,
it gives us 3 factors mmmm ,let's find the primes using prime.py script 

the resault was :

Number 1 is probably prime.
Number 2 is probably prime.
Number 3 is composite.

so we should factor number3 ,factor.db didn't work this time let's do a script python factor.py 

 the result is 
 Trying to factor r (this may take a while)...
 Factors of r found:

nice ,now we can use multi factor role n=p*q*r*l....
we have 4 , let's do the script of RSAMulti.py the result is 

0x24e55d8024bbdfcdbf69c197305d0e7e7c69e59ae5b5fbcffc5d67426a78a1dc76bf30cbdc82a152645b5515e3968f76c8a006bf5cc79ba1d18c4680aa37864ba4


witch is the righ hex with the same length as others ,next step is replace it in the line 1443 , i put the result in solFile and applicate the xor to all the lines to find the flag using sol.py script the result is 

### Flag: nexus{x0r_ft_Rs1!_S0rry!_but_ch4tGpt_c4n_n0t_s0lv3_3v3ryTh1ng!!}
